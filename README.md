# 📊 Tableau Dashboard for Google Fiber Customer Support  

This project is part of the [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/decisions-decisions-dashboards-and-reports/supplement/Ufo5r/activity-exemplar-build-a-dashboard-for-google-fiber) on data visualization and dashboard design. The goal of this project is to analyze **customer service efficiency** by examining repeat calls in different markets and identifying key trends in customer interactions.  

🔗 **Live Dashboard:** [View on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/koosha.mehdipoor/viz/GoogleFiber_17437643576580/Third#1)  

## 📌 Project Overview  

The **Google Fiber Customer Service team** wants to assess how often customers call support after their first inquiry. This helps leadership understand how well the team resolves issues on the first call and where improvements are needed.  

This dashboard provides:  
✅ **Repeat call analysis** to measure customer service effectiveness  
✅ **Insights into call trends** by market and issue type  
✅ **Breakdowns by time period** (week, month, quarter, year)  

## 📊 Dashboard Insights  

### **1️⃣ Repeats by Month**  
- In **2025**, around **9% of day 0 calls** lead to a second call.  
- **Mondays and Fridays** are the busiest days for the customer service team, while **Sundays** have the fewest calls.  

### **2️⃣ Call Trends by Market & Issue Type**  
- In **Market 1**, there is a **significant spike in repeat calls** for **Type 2** and **Type 5 issues** on day 0.  
- **Market 3** also shows a high number of repeat calls for **Type 5 issues**, suggesting unresolved problems in that category.  

### **3️⃣ Day 1 Call Patterns**  
- Markets **1 and 3** show a **high number of second calls**, indicating issues that are not being resolved properly on the first call.  
- This could suggest a need for **better training or improved support resources**.  

### **4️⃣ Additional Observations**  
- **Wednesday and Thursday** also see **higher repeat call rates**, which may indicate mid-week service inefficiencies.  
- Some issue types have consistently higher **repeat call percentages**, suggesting **systematic service gaps**.
