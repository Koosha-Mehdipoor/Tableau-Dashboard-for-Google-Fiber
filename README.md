## 📈 Key Insights & Actionable Recommendations

### **📅 Repeat Calls by Month**
- **In 2022**, around **9%** of **day 0 calls** lead to a **second call**.  
  🔹 *Possible Issue:* Customers may not be getting clear or complete answers in their first interaction.  
  🔹 **Recommendation:** Investigate which **call types contribute most** to repeat calls and **train agents accordingly**.  

- **Mondays and Fridays** are the busiest days for the CS team, while **Sundays** are the calmest.  
  🔹 *Possible Issue:* Weekend inquiries might be spilling over into Mondays, causing a backlog.  
  🔹 **Recommendation:** Adjust **staff scheduling** to allocate more agents on Mondays and Fridays to manage peak demand.  

### **📊 Market Trends**
- **Market 1** shows a **spike** in **day 0 calls** for **issue types 2 and 5**.  
  🔹 *Possible Issue:* These issue types may not be fully resolved in the first call.  
  🔹 **Recommendation:** Conduct a **root cause analysis** to determine why these issues persist and update **knowledge base articles**.  

- **Markets 1 & 3** have a noticeable **increase in second calls on Day 1**, indicating unresolved issues.  
  🔹 *Possible Issue:* Agents in these markets may need **additional training** or better knowledge resources.  
  🔹 **Recommendation:** Review **call transcripts** to identify common points of confusion and improve **internal documentation**.
